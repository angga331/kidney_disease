This machine learning use KSVNN algorithm, combination of both KNN and Support Vectors theorem.

Using KSVNN algorithm, K-Support Vector Nearest Neighbor, which is a custom algorithm based on academic journals regarding machine learning algorithm, making better results in evaluation rather than original KNN. Instead of using original neighbor calculation, here we filtered it more into support vectors, same references to SVV algorithm.
